The Bioconductor Code of Conduct committee (CoCc) is responsible for developing, deseminating,
and upholding the Code of Conduct. The CoCc reports to the Bioconductor Community Advisory Board. It is currently chaired by Saskia Freytag. Membership is by invitation only, but community members are invited to contribute to via raising an issue (see below).
